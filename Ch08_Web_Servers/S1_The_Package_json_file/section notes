A package.json file is a manifest that contains information about our app.
It will allow us to easily distribute our application code without having to worry about distributing all the dependencies as well. 

packages: express, cors, body-parser

npm install <package name> --save

The --save flag will add this dependency to my package.json file 









So, the package.json file is important for everyone of our node applications or libraries. It gives us a manifest of information about the package and it also keeps track of all the dependencies that this package requires.
